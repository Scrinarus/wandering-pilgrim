wp_pilgrim,SHIP," A heavily modified Invictus, occupied by a sect of the Luddic Faithful who have operated it since the Second AI War. It has been retrofitted to enable permanent human habitation and limited industrial capacity, at the cost of offensive capabilities compared to the base hull. The interior can comfortably support a population of nearly ten thousand, with minimal imports or assistance from outside.

Originally known as the Unbreakable Heart, the ship had a venerable career in the First AI War. After its conclusion, the crew had developed more radical beliefs and staged a mutiny against the church when recalled so the ship could be decomissioned. Her crew chose the name Wandering Pilgrim and took up the banner of the Luddic Path after escaping attempts by the church to reclaim the ship by force.

Its most prominent appearance within the core worlds was during one of the many Luddic uprisings on Mazalot, providing support and militant forces for the local Pather sects, until arriving League fleets forced the ship to withdraw and doom the budding revolution. During this brief stint on Mazalot many Luddic faithful refugees were brought aboard before withdrawing from the planet, bolstering its population and shifting the demographics away from the radical Luddic Path. This marked a transition of the Wandering Pilgrim's role into that of a mobile town.

Today many thousands of faithful live aboard and have for generations and relations with the church have become more amicable, with the Knights of Ludd offering aid and military assistance to the Pilgrim as necessary.",,,,,
