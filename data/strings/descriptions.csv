wp_pilgrim,SHIP," A heavily modified Invictus, occupied by a sect of the Luddic Faithful who have operated it since the Second AI War. It has been retrofitted to enable permanent human habitation and limited industrial capacity, at the cost of offensive capabilities compared to the base hull. The interior can comfortably support a population of nearly ten thousand, with minimal imports or assistance from outside.

Originally known as the Unbreakable Heart, the ship had a venerable career in the First AI War. After its conclusion, the crew had developed more radical beliefs and staged a mutiny against the church when recalled so the ship could be decomissioned. Her crew chose the name Wandering Pilgrim and took up the banner of the Luddic Path after escaping attempts by the church to reclaim the ship by force.

Its most prominent appearance within the core worlds was during one of the many Luddic uprisings on Mazalot, providing support and militant forces for the local Pather sects, until arriving League fleets forced the ship to withdraw and doom the budding revolution. During this brief stint on Mazalot many Luddic faithful refugees were brought aboard before withdrawing from the planet, bolstering its population and shifting the demographics away from the radical Luddic Path. This marked a transition of the Wandering Pilgrim's role into that of a mobile town.

Today many thousands of faithful live aboard and have for generations. Relations with the Church have become more amicable, with the Knights of Ludd offering aid and military assistance to the Pilgrim as necessary.",,,,,

wp_pilgrim_station_volturn,CUSTOM,"An ancient, partially demilitarized Invictus recovered from some long forgotten conflict, the Wandering Pilgrim is home to thousands of faithful who maintain this holy vessel as it travels the Pilgrim's Path.",,"Despite the harsh laws instituted by Andrada's regime, the Pilgrim remains untouched. Andrada, for his part, knew the influence Luddics held in the Hegemony and sector at large, and expressly allowed the venerable ship passage as a placating act. The modern Diktat continues this tradition, although they seem to coral more than a few unwilling Luddic faithful into the vessel each visit. There are calls for action among some of the Pilgrim's elders, to free those trapped on Cruor, although the senior-most leadership remain aware of the potential martyrdom that'd befall the ship should they try anything obvious.",,,

Even after a century, the Church remains suspicious of it's peculiar sect.",,,
wp_pilgrim_station_jangala,CUSTOM,"An ancient, partially demilitarized Invictus recovered from some long forgotten conflict, the Wandering Pilgrim is home to thousands of faithful who maintain this holy vessel as it travels the Pilgrim's Path.",,"Visits to Jangala by the Pilgrim are often met with exasperation by MuniSec. While protests against the orbital burns are a weekly occurance, the Pilgrim's arrival is almost always followed by significantly increased Luddic activity. For the period that the Pilgrim remains in orbit, it stays uncomfortably close to the orbital burn infrastructure, and provides medical aid to those protestors injured by the riot control forces. A steady stream of pilgims make their way planetside to the shrine.",,,
wp_pilgrim_station_killa,CUSTOM,"An ancient, partially demilitarized Invictus recovered from some long forgotten conflict, the Wandering Pilgrim is home to thousands of faithful who maintain this holy vessel as it travels the Pilgrim's Path.",,"The Pilgrim's visit to Killa is a somber one. The nomadic ship had made the voyage to it and Hanan Pacha a mere half cycle before their destruction at the hands of the Second AI War. Counted among its crew today are many who's families and friends were lost in the radioactive dust. Quietly, a ritual plays out, one held each visit: a stream of radio signals are sent down, one by one, from the ancient vessel onto the ruined surface. Letters to kin, now lost, but not forgotten.",,,
wp_pilgrim_station_beholder,CUSTOM,"An ancient, partially demilitarized Invictus recovered from some long forgotten conflict, the Wandering Pilgrim is home to thousands of faithful who maintain this holy vessel as it travels the Pilgrim's Path.",,"Always on the more radical end of the spectrum of Luddic beliefs, the denizens of Beholder Station are more welcoming to the Pilgrim than most. Indeed, here the Faithful mingle more than any other port, and Beholder Station is the closest the Pilgrim comes to a true ""port call"".",,,
wp_pilgrim_station_hesperus,CUSTOM,"An ancient, partially demilitarized Invictus recovered from some long forgotten conflict, the Wandering Pilgrim is home to thousands of faithful who maintain this holy vessel as it travels the Pilgrim's Path.",,"Hesperus is, ironically, a more dangerous location for the Pilgrim than even Volturn. The Lion wishes not to anger the Church, but the Church does not regulate itself nearly as well as it attempts to regulate others. Attempts to invasively document the craft, or even put it under lockdown and dissolve the Pilgrim's sect, have been made throughout the cycles. Today, the peace is tenuously held, with the vigilance of Orbis staring down the bow of the craft while it orbits overhead.",,,
