Goliath Hangar,wp_GoliathHangar,,,,,,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,data.hullmods.wp_GoliathHangar,"The original Invictus hangar bay is massive by Sector standards, but still not large enough to support the Wandering Pilgrim's population. To remedy this, the hangar bays have been greatly expanded and bulkheads removed to retrofit the structure into a miniature spaceport. This provides space for built-in fighter bays, with room for additional nanoforge capacity to be brought online. 

The base number of fighter bays is %s, and installing Converted Hangars increases the number of bays to %s and negates all penalties from Converted Hangar",Increases the effect of Converted Hangar and removes its penalities.,,graphics/hullmods/wp_goliath_hangar.png
Handwrought Armor,wp_HandwroughtArmor,,,,,,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,data.hullmods.wp_HandwroughtArmor,"Decades of wear from impacts, accidents, and the infrequent skirmish necessitated endless repairs to the armor. Eventually it became more worthwhile to build over existing layers proactively, and use repairs as opportunities for remodelling. Growing from small patches on the bow to eventually the entire hull, the remade armor was and remains the most extreme modification made to the Pilgrim over the base Invictus hull. 

The task of replacing shattered and blown off bulkheads with entirely new material, installed and designed by hand, became an important part of the culture aboard the Pilgrim. Rather than using the clean and identical sheets spit out by nanoforges, the Pilgrim was tended to with material gathered, refined, and shaped using more traditional techniques and equipment. An act of rejecting dependence on the bones of the Domain, returning to a form of manufacturing more in line with Luddic beliefs. Today, the hull is adorned with decals, murals, excerpts from scripture and messages painted on the hull by those who labored to tend to it.

Subpar material and construction quality reduces total armor by %s, but the new layers have been constructed with modern knowledge of armor schemes, entirely negating the effects of the Ablative Armor hullmod.",Reduces total armor but makes armor non-ablative.,,graphics/hullmods/wp_handwrought_armor2.png
