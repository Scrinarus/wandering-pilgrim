# wandering-pilgrim
A mod for Starsector focusing on a traveling Luddic Invictus Colony. The goal is primarily to focus on story writing, utilizing Arthr's Arkoship code when he completes making it portable into other mods. 
Until then, the Pilgrim uses a simplified movement system, teleporting between the Pilgrim's Path shrines as well as Mazalot on the first of each month.
