# wandering-pilgrim
A mod for Starsector focusing on a traveling Luddic Invictus Colony. The goal is primarily to focus on story writing, utilizing Arthr's Arkoship code when he completes making it portable into other mods.

Currently incredibly WIP - the ship exists, the sprites exist, and it can be obtained via console commands. We will add more content soon!
